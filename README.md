# bahaar-wave-practice

Note: All commands start with the prefix `/8 bahaar`


Command | Description
--- | ---
summon | Summons bahaar to your player location
wave | Makes bahaar do a wave. Look in proxy chat for which type of wave it is

This version was forked from the original module. I just changed a few bytes so that it works again.
